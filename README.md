## Motivation

Not that we needed another weather app. I just wanted to make use of the new api provided by the Portuguese institute - and this seemed like a good opportunity to
test the new DotNet Core Razor Pages web technology.
 
## Requirements

- Dotnet core 2.2 [https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2)
